**Open-source client reporting for marketing agencies.** Every client's ad and analytics numbers in one
place, with your agency's branding. Self-host it in one command, or use our cloud.

> **Status: preparing for public release.**

## Who this is for

- Marketing agencies with 8 to 30 active clients.
- Teams that run Meta Ads, Google Ads, GA4, HubSpot, Klaviyo or Shopify for clients and spend Monday mornings on reports.
- Anyone who wants client reporting on their own server, with their own data.

## Quick start
Hostinger VPS KVM2	
```
https://www.hostinger.com/cart?product=vps%3Avps_kvm_2&period=12&referral_type=cart_link&REFERRALCODE=aidatahouse&referral_id=019bd221-ccf9-71b5-b517-49d2d540cdb1
```
One command on a Linux box with Docker:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BraidScope/braidscope-agency-reporting/main/deploy/selfhost/install.sh | bash
```

It prints the URL and the first owner login. With a real domain, HTTPS turns on by itself:

```bash
BRAIDSCOPE_DOMAIN=app.example.com BRAIDSCOPE_EMAIL=you@example.com \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BraidScope/braidscope-agency-reporting/main/deploy/selfhost/install.sh)"
```

Everything else, including upgrade, backup and moving from the cloud, is in [docs/self-host.md](docs/self-host.md).

## Self-host or cloud

| Self-host (this repo, free) | Braidscope Cloud |
|---|---|
| Every connector: Google Ads, Meta Ads, GA4, HubSpot, Klaviyo, Shopify | The same, hosted and kept working when platforms change their APIs |
| Dashboards, reports, PDF download, Ask AI | Backups, upgrades and monitoring done for you |
| Team and roles, client workspaces | White-label domains, priority support |
| You run it on your server | We run it: [braidscope.com](https://braidscope.com) |

White-label and larger plans: contact us through the site.

## How it is built

| Folder | What |
|---|---|
| `web/` | React app (Vite, JSX) |
| `py/` | Python backend (FastAPI): connectors, dashboards, Ask AI, reports |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Database schema and row level security (Postgres with the Supabase extensions) |
| `deploy/selfhost/` | The one-command stack: Postgres, auth, storage, backend, app, HTTPS |
| `docs/` | Install, upgrade, backup, migration |

`AGENTS.md` describes the architecture and the rules in detail.

## Why open source

Agencies hand their clients' ad accounts and analytics to a reporting tool. You should be able to read
the code that holds those tokens, run it on your own server, and leave at any time with your data. The
cloud version pays for the work; the code stays open.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Connector requests and votes go in Issues.

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Short version: run the checks, sign your commits (`git commit -s`),
one topic per PR, no real keys anywhere. Connectors for new platforms are welcome.

## Security

Connectors only read. No connector writes to a platform, and the AI assistant can only call read-only
tools. That is enforced by a policy file and a CI test, not by convention: see
[docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md). To add a platform, read
[docs/connectors.md](docs/connectors.md); a scaffold command gets you a working package in a minute.

## Licence

AGPL-3.0-only. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

In plain words: you can run it, change it and share it. If you offer a modified Braidscope to others
over a network, you must publish your changes under the same licence. If that does not fit your
business, a commercial licence is available: hello@braidscope.com. The name and logo are trademarks,
see [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md). Security problems: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
